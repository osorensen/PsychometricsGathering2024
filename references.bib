  abstract = {This article presents dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM), which can be used to study the evolution of observed and latent variables as well as the structural equation models over time. DSEM is suitable for analyzing intensive longitudinal data where observations from multiple individuals are collected at many points in time. The modeling framework encompasses previously published DSEM models and is a comprehensive attempt to combine time-series modeling with structural equation modeling. DSEM is estimated with Bayesian methods using the Markov chain Monte Carlo Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis--Hastings sampler. We provide a detailed description of the estimation algorithm as implemented in the Mplus software package. DSEM can be used for longitudinal analysis of any duration and with any number of observations across time. Simulation studies are used to illustrate the framework and study the performance of the estimation method. Methods for evaluating model fit are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Most prior research has focused on characterizing averages in cognition, brain characteristics, or behavior, and attempting to predict differences in these averages among individuals. However, this overwhelming focus on mean levels may leave us with an incomplete picture of what drives individual differences in behavioral phenotypes by ignoring the variability of behavior around an individual's mean. In particular, enhanced white matter (WM) structural microstructure has been hypothesized to support consistent behavioral performance by decreasing Gaussian noise in signal transfer. Conversely, lower indices of WM microstructure are associated with greater within-subject variance in the ability to deploy performance-related resources, especially in clinical populations. We tested a mechanistic account of the ``neural noise'' hypothesis in a large adult lifespan cohort (Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience) with over 2500 adults (ages 18-102; 1508 female; 1173 male; 2681 behavioral sessions; 708 MRI scans) using WM fractional anisotropy to predict mean levels and variability in reaction time performance on a simple behavioral task using a dynamic structural equation model. By modeling robust and reliable individual differences in within-person variability, we found support for a neural noise hypothesis (Kail, 1997), with lower fractional anisotropy predicted individual differences in separable components of behavioral performance estimated using dynamic structural equation model, including slower mean responses and increased variability. These effects remained when including age, suggesting consistent effects of WM microstructure across the adult lifespan unique from concurrent effects of aging. Crucially, we show that variability can be reliably separated from mean performance using advanced modeling tools, enabling tests of distinct hypotheses for each component of performance. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Human cognitive performance is defined not just by the long-run average, but trial-to-trial variability around that average. However, investigations of cognitive abilities and changes during aging have largely ignored this variability component of behavior. We provide evidence that white matter (WM) microstructure predicts individual differences in mean performance and variability in a sample spanning the adult lifespan (18-102). Unlike prior studies of cognitive performance and variability, we modeled variability directly and distinct from mean performance using a dynamic structural equation model, which allows us to decouple variability from mean performance and other complex features of performance (e.g., autoregression). The effects of WM were robust above the effect of age, highlighting the role of WM in promoting fast and consistent performance.},

Common methods in this area are related to time-series analysis, a framework that historically has received little exposure in psychology. There is a scarcity of psychology-based resources introducing the basic ideas of time-series analysis, especially for data sets featuring multiple people. We begin with basics of N = 1 time-series analysis and build up to complex dynamic structural equation models available in the newest release of Mplus Version 8. The goal is to provide readers with a basic conceptual understanding of common models, template code, and result interpretation. We provide short descriptions of some advanced issues, but our main priority is to supply readers with a solid knowledge base so that the more advanced literature on the topic is more readily digestible to a larger group of researchers.

By the end of 1976, 45 of them had developed clinical coronary heart disease (CHD) which showed two main relationships with diet. Men with a high energy intake had a lower rate of disease than the rest, and, independently of this, so did men with a high intake of dietary fibre from cereals. Energy intake reflects physical activity, but the advantage of a diet high in cereal fibre cannot be explained; there was no evidence that the disease was associated with consumption of refined carbohydrates. Fewer cases of CHD developed among men with a relatively high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids in their diet, but the difference was not statistically significant.},

  abstract = {A unifying framework for generalized multilevel structural equation modeling is introduced. The models in the framework, called generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM), combine features of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and structural equation models (SEM) and consist of a response model and a structural model for the latent variables. The response model generalizes GLMMs to incorporate factor structures in addition to random intercepts and coefficients. As in GLMMs, the data can have an arbitrary number of levels and can be highly unbalanced with different numbers of lower-level units in the higher-level units and missing data. A wide range of response processes can be modeled including ordered and unordered categorical responses, counts, and responses of mixed types. The structural model is similar to the structural part of a SEM except that it may include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. For example, unit-level latent variables (factors or random coefficients) can be regressed on cluster-level latent variables. Special cases of this framework are explored and data from the British Social Attitudes Survey are used for illustration. Maximum likelihood estimation and empirical Bayes latent score prediction within the GLLAMM framework can be performed using adaptive quadrature in gllamm, a freely available program running in Stata.},

  abstract = {The availability of intensive longitudinal data has rapidly increased, and with it our ability to understand how behavior evolves. Statistical models to analyze such data often include dynamics parameters that capture dependencies within or between variables over time. However, these dynamics parameters are typically thought to operate independently of the current value of the time series. Here, we argue that by doing so important information on psychological processes is overlooked. We therefore propose the DYNamics of ASymmetric TIme series (or DYNASTI) approach in which dynamics parameters are allowed to differ, depending on whether they operate above, or below, the time series mean of a given person or unit of analysis. For instance, the effect of exercise on health outcomes may vary depending on whether a person exercises more, or less, than average. Or, the inertia of sleep may vary depending on whether a person sleeps more, or less, than their average. Through extensive simulations, we show that DYNASTI implementations of two commonly used time series models (DSEM and RI-CLPM) are able to adequately recover both symmetric and asymmetric temporal dynamics above and below the time series mean. Importantly, we also show that assuming symmetric dynamics (as in the vast majority of the literature) when processes are in fact asymmetric leads to incorrect conclusions about these dynamics. We further illustrate the workings of DYNASTI implementations and how they can lead to new insights in empirical examples regarding negative affect, smoking urges, and anxiety. To implement, and extend, DYNASTI models we provide an annotated, open source code base built in RStan. Together, these results advocate DYNASTI implementations as a new default for time series modeling.},

A scalable maximum likelihood estimation algorithm is proposed, utilizing the Laplace approximation, sparse matrix computation, and automatic differentiation. Mixed response types, heteroscedasticity, and crossed random effects are naturally incorporated into the framework. The models developed were motivated by applications in cognitive neuroscience, and two case studies are presented. First, we show how GALAMMs can jointly model the complex lifespan trajectories of episodic memory, working memory, and speed/executive function, measured by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), digit span tests, and Stroop tests, respectively. Next, we study the effect of socioeconomic status on brain structure, using data on education and income together with hippocampal volumes estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. By combining semiparametric estimation with latent variable modeling, GALAMMs allow a more realistic representation of how brain and cognition vary across the lifespan, while simultaneously estimating latent traits from measured items. Simulation experiments suggest that model estimates are accurate even with moderate sample sizes.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of estimating how different parts of the brain develop and change throughout the lifespan, and how these trajectories are affected by genetic and environmental factors. Estimation of these lifespan trajectories is statistically challenging, since their shapes are typically highly nonlinear, and although true change can only be quantified by longitudinal examinations, as follow-up intervals in neuroimaging studies typically cover less than 10\% of the lifespan, use of cross-sectional information is necessary. Linear mixed models (LMMs) and structural equation models (SEMs) commonly used in longitudinal analysis rely on assumptions which are typically not met with lifespan data, in particular when the data consist of observations combined from multiple studies. While LMMs require a priori specification of a polynomial functional form, SEMs do not easily handle data with unstructured time intervals between measurements. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) offer an attractive alternative, and in this paper we propose various ways of formulating GAMMs for estimation of lifespan trajectories of 12 brain regions, using a large longitudinal dataset and realistic simulation experiments. We show that GAMMs are able to more accurately fit lifespan trajectories, distinguish longitudinal and cross-sectional effects, and estimate effects of genetic and environmental exposures. Finally, we discuss and contrast questions related to lifespan research which strictly require repeated measures data and questions which can be answered with a single measurement per participant, and in the latter case, which simplifying assumptions that need to be made. The examples are accompanied with R code, providing a tutorial for researchers interested in using GAMMs.},
